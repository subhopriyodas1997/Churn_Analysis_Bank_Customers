# Churn_Analysis_Bank_Customers

#Step.1. Data Collection and Preparation: Connect to, clean and transform raw data using Power Query Editor. 
#Assign 1st row values a column headers.
#Rename columns.
#Remove unnecessary columns.
#Change type of values from strings to integers or integers to text as needed. 
#Create new columns from previous columns. 
#Edit values in rows using "Replace Values" function. 
#Convert values like "0" and "1" from integer to string. Then using "Replace Values" function convert "0" in "Credit Card Status" column to "Not Owned" and "1" to "Owned". Then the count function can be used in the latter stages when dashboard is made. 
#We similarly arrange the "Activity Status" and "Churn Status" columns.
#Then we use age groups to categorically arrange the individual ages given. 
#We do the same for "credit score" and "Balance" columns because that column also has so many different values. Then we change data type of these conditional columns from integer to string.
